1 - Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Created solution that had same time complexity but worse space complexity
- Saw model solution, understood it immediately, and changed og solution to follow it without looking at it 


2 - Smallest Subarray with a given sum
- Knew what the correct algorithm / solution was. Just couldn't figure out how to represent it as code
- Saw model solution, took some time to understand how code was working but went through an example and understood eventually, changed og solution to follow it without looking at it
